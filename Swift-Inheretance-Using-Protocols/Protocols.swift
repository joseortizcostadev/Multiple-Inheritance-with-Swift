///- Description: This file contains the structure Course, and the protocols Faculty
///               and Graduate. The Course structure represents a structure with basic
///               info about a specific course. The protocols Faculty and Graduate are
///               used to be inhereted from other classes e.g Faculty->Lecturer or
///               Lecturer->Graduate Student as professor assistant. This protocols
///               may provide multiple inheretance for classes that inherit from 
///               them.
///- Important:   Note that Faculty and Graduate protocols implement its signature 
///               methods in their own extensions. The advantages of this technique
///               is that those methods do not need to be implemented by the classes
///               that inherit from them.
